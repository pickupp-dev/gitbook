## Order Price & Billable Weight

* The estimated and final order price is calculated based on the billable weight.
* Billable weight is used to determine the price you will pay to ship your goods. It can be either the gross weight (i.e. actual weight) or the volumetric weight (i.e. dimensional weight) of the parcel, whichever is greater.
  * Two weights are considered as your shipment might take up more space than you had anticipated. So couriers use dimensional weight as a means to help manage the balance between size and weight.
  * Actual weight is the weight of parcel rounded up to the next half kg. Use a scale to determine the weight of the package.
  * Dimensional weight reflects the amount of space a parcel occupies in relation to its actual weight. Determine this by measuring the parcel dimensions in centimetres. Multiply the length by the width by the height. The result is the cubic size in centimetres. Divide the cubic size by 5,000 to determine the dimensional weight. Increase any fraction to the next half kg.
* For multiple-parcel shipments, we will consolidate parcels into one large parcel or parcels for the most economical billable weight.
* After the order is created and we have received your parcels, we will re-measure and re-weigh all parcels, then contact you and confirm with you the final total dimension, actual weight, and thus billable weight. You will know the final order price before we hand over the shipment to our international courier partner.
* We will charge your credit card if the final order price is larger than the estimated order price. Conversely, we will refund any surplus back to your credit card.

## Courier Waybill & Commercial Invoice

* Our international courier partner will require the below documents. We will complete and print these for you.
  1. Courier waybill - we will prepare this based on the order details you entered.
  2. Commercial invoice - three identical copies is required. We will prepare this based on the customs declaration information you provided.
* In special cases where you need to print the above documents, our Pickupp support team will contact you and walk you through the process.

## FAQ

1. How do I measure an irregularly shaped parcel?

* Measure irregularly shaped parcels as if they were in a rectangular box. Measure the length, width and height of the theoretical parcel from its extreme points to determine the parcel’s dimensions.
* The maximum weight per package is 70 kg, and the maximum length is 274 cm.
* When considering the size of the package, both length and girth are taken into account. The combined length and girth should not exceed 400 centimeters. To calculate the girth, use the formula: Length + 2 times Width + 2 times Height. Keep in mind that the longest side of your parcel will be considered the length.

2. Why is the final charging price different from the quoted price on the website?

There could be a few reasons for this discrepancy:&#x20;

* The weight entered when placing the order may not match the actual weight verified by Pickupp. Please note that when comparing the actual weight and dimensional weight of the parcel, the higher of the two weights will be used as the checkout weight for rate calculation.
* The final chargeable weight measured by Pickupp's recognized electronic scale will be considered as the definitive weight.
* Fuel charges and peak season surcharges are included in the quoted rate. However, if there is a price difference in the surcharge from the provider, the final amount will be based on the provider's rate, and Pickupp reserves the right to charge back the difference.

3. What is the estimated delivery time for international shipments?

* The estimated delivery time for international shipments is typically between 3 to 6 days, depending on the destination.

4. What is the difference of actual weight and dimension weight?

* Dimensional weight, also known as volumetric weight, is a calculation used to determine the weight of a package based on its size rather than its actual weight. It is calculated by multiplying the length, height, and width of the package and dividing the result by a volumetric factor, typically 5000.\
