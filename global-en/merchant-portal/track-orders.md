## FAQ

1. What happens if my international package is held at customs?

* If your international package is held at customs, it means that customs authorities are inspecting it or require additional information or fees. This can cause delays in the delivery process. You may need to provide documentation, pay duties or taxes, or comply with import regulations. It's important to cooperate with customs and follow their instructions to ensure a smooth clearance process.
