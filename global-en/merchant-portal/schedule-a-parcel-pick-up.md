# Schedule a Parcel Pick Up

Pickupp offers free pick up service for international orders. Schedule a pick up by selecting "Schedule Bulk Collection" in the side menu bar on the left hand side after you have created Global orders (refer to [Create a Global Order](create-a-global-order.md) or [Bulk Create Global Orders](bulk-create-global-orders.md)).

Please note that the daily cutoff time for parcel pick up is 10:00am. If you confirm a pick up before 10:00am, our agent will arrive at the pick up address on the next business day between 10:00am and 6:00pm. If the pick up is confirmed after 10:00am, our agent will arrive two business days later between 10:00am and 06:00pm.
