## What is Pickupp Delivery+?

Pickupp Delivery+ is a service provided by Pickupp that goes beyond simple delivery. It is a delivery with added service that allows users to place orders and describe additional tasks they need assistance with. Users can visit the platform, specify their requirements, and request the help of a freelancer. The pricing for Delivery+ includes an additional $5 surcharge on the base price of the distance-based fee for Pickupp's 4-hour delivery product, but users should also add "acceptance tips" based on the complexity of the tasks required to increase the chances of finding a match. If the order is not accepted by a freelancer, the request will be cancelled and fully refunded, ensuring a success-based and free-of-charge experience. It offers greater flexibility to individuals, businesses, and enterprises, enabling them to easily find ad hoc help for various tasks.

### Here are a few examples of how Pickupp Delivery+ can be used:

1.  Example 1: Moving Assistance

    * Let's say you need help moving furniture from one location to another. With Delivery+, you can place an order specifying the pick-up and drop-off locations, as well as the additional task of moving the furniture. A freelancer who accepts the order will not only deliver the items but also assist with the moving process, providing you with the extra help you need.


2.  Example 2: Event Setup

    * Imagine you're organising an event and need assistance with setting up equipment and decorations at the venue. By using Delivery+, you can place an order with the event location as the drop-off point and describe the specific tasks required, such as setting up tables, chairs, and decorations. A freelancer who accepts the order will not only deliver the items but also help with the setup, ensuring a smooth event preparation process.


3. Example 3: Document Retrieval
   * Suppose you need important documents from a specific location but are unable to retrieve them yourself. Through Delivery+, you can place an order to have a freelancer pick up the documents and deliver them to your desired location. You can provide clear instructions on where to find the documents and any additional requirements, ensuring a secure and efficient retrieval process.

These examples demonstrate how Delivery+ offers more than just simple delivery. It allows users to request assistance with specific tasks, enabling them to accomplish multiple objectives in a single order. With the added flexibility of acceptance tips, users can increase the likelihood of finding a suitable match and receive the help they need.
