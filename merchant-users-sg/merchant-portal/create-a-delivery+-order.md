6. Input optional details.
   * "Notes" - Use this to list any your special requests or specific instructions as a to-do list. It is important to be as specific and descriptive as possible to ensure that your instructions are understood.
   * Tips and important points to consider when inputting your notes:
     * Be specific and use concise wording. Clearly communicate your requirements or any additional information related to the task. This helps ensure that the instructions are understood accurately.
     * Use language that is easy to understand, as if you were explaining the task to a new employee. This clarity helps avoid any confusion or misunderstandings.
     * If you need the freelancer to call you for any reason, you can mention this in the notes. This allows for direct communication and coordination.
     * While there is no limit to the instructions you can provide, it is essential to ensure that they are legal and within the guidelines of the platform.
   * _Note: complex instructions may make it more challenging to find a freelancer willing to complete a complex task._
   * "Client Reference Number" - you may input any internal order reference number that you have. This reference number can be used for order tracking.

10. While there is a $5 surcharge imposed on the base price for every Delivery+ order, users are urged to add additional tips proportionate to the complexity of the tasks required to ensure that the order is fairly-priced. This will ensure that the freelancers are fairly compensated for the tasks completed and will increase the likelihood of the order being successfully matched to a freelancer. You may refer to the [add tips](add-tips-to-speed-up-agent-matching.md) section on how to add additional tips to your order.
