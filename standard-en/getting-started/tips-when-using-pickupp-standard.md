2. Collection service will be arranged for at least 5 scheduled orders. Collection service will be automatically arranged after at least 5 scheduled orders are created. For orders created before 12:00 noon, merchants shall get all the parcels ready for pickup at 12:00, and expect the collection courier will come between the same day 12:00-18:00. The collection courier may call you to confirm the collection time. For orders created after 12:00, merchants shall expect the parcels to be collected within 12:00-18:00 next day.
3. Each small parcel (under 20kg) order will have 2 attempts, each large parcel (20kg or above) order will have 1 attempt. Recipients have to pay for additional $80 in cash for each additional attempt.
4. If the recipient is unreachable for 3 days, the parcel will be returned to the CAINIAO warehouse to wait for the next instruction.
5. If the delivery address does not have elevators/lifts, or the elevators/lifts are unavailable, additional charge applies to the recipient. Recipients could choose to receive the parcel at ground floor for free.
6. Special arrangements and fees will be applied to dropoff points at restricted areas (including but not limited to islands, country park, school, hospital, warehouses or paid areas).
7. Parcels fail to be delivered after all free or scheduled attempts, or the recipient rejects the parcel, the delivery fee will be charged in full, and the parcel will be returned to CAINIAO warehouse for merchant pickup without charge within 30 days. Merchants can request for a return to the original pickup address with a delivery fee on each returning parcel.

11. The service partner may change the pick-up service arrangements and charges at any time.
12. You can check the order status updates provided by the service provider through the Pickupp merchant app.
13. You may get more order status by searching your order with the Pickupp Order Number (e.g. PU111122223333HK) in https://pbc.cainiao.com/orderStatusSearch

20. Please do not use the Multiparcel feature. It is recommended to have one single container to store all the items, or use tape to combine and bind the items if there are multiple items in an order, and use only ONE waybill. If you use the multiparcel feature, the order status may not be displayed correctly. Each parcel with a waybill will be charged as an individual order.
