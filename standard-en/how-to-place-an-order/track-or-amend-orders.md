* Before reaching out for any inquiries post-collection, make sure you have your sender phone number ready. This is an important detail that the service provider will need alongside the waybill number to assist you. \

* If you need to track your order status or have any further questions or requests, contact the service provider directly. To do this, use the contact information provided in the reminder from SO, which includes the customer service number for the partner. \

* When you call or email, provide the service provider with the waybill number and your sender phone number. \

* If you need to change the recipient's information, the delivery address, or if you request the return of a parcel, please be aware that these actions may incur additional fees.
