## Reassigning an Order

Reassigning an order involves canceling the existing trip and dispatching a new trip to another agent. The agent who receives the reassigned order will need to go through the pickup process again (i.e. starting from the order status Assigned). See [Viewing and Accepting Orders](../delivery-agent-app/viewing-and-accepting-orders.md) via the Delivery Agent App.

1. Go to the "Order List" in the Fleet Portal.
