# Managing Waybill

## Get Start with Waybill

The waybill is an important document that includes order details and guidelines for shipping goods. In the Pickupp Fleet Management System, merchants can generate the waybill through the Merchant Portal. Last-mile delivery vendors use the waybill to sort parcels and hand them to drivers. It provides code for on-site sorting, ensuring packages are assigned to the correct locations.

The waybill allows fleet companies to customize their information in two sections:

1. Fleet Company Logo:
   * Fleet companies can upload their logo, which will be displayed on the waybill.
   * This feature helps to brand and personalize the waybill with the company's visual identity.
2. Delivery Zone Code:
   * The waybill includes a section to display the unique zone code for both the Pickup and Dropoff addresses.
   * This code is essential for identifying and sorting packages to the correct location upon arrival at the warehouse.

## Zone Code on Waybill

In the My Zone section, you can manage your delivery zone by specifying its name and coverage area. This ensures that your orders are sorted into the correct delivery zone. However, to streamline the sorting process in the warehouse during delivery, it is beneficial to have zone code information on the waybill. This allows the operations team to easily identify the code on-site and efficiently sort packages to the correct locations before handing them over to the drivers.
