# Updating Order Status

This is particularly useful when a delivery agent is unable to complete the pickup or drop-off process due to poor signal, incorrect GPS detection, or other accidents.  The below will cover two important status updates: transitioning an order from "Accepted" to "Enroute" and transitioning an order from "Enroute" to "Delivered".

## Manual Enroute

This is a specific type of order status update that changes the order status from "Accepted" to "Enroute."

To manually update the order status:

1. Open the "Order list". This is where you can see all the orders.
2. At the top of the Order list, find the button labeled "Actions" and click on it. A dropdown menu will appear. In the dropdown menu, select "Enroute". This will list all the orders that are currently Accepted and ready to be placed Enroute.
3. Search and select the order for which you want to set the status to Enroute:
   * By default, the order list will show orders which are in "Accepted" status only.
   * By default, the list will be showing "Today’s" order only.
4. You can filter the order by Date.
5. You can filter the order with the PUDO District.
6. You can search for orders by entering any of the following keywords:
   * Order Number
   * PUDO address
   * CRN
7. You can search for orders by assigned agents using:
   * Agent Name
   * Agent Contact

8. Click "Next" to proceed.
9. Review the order details and click "Confirm" to proceed with the status update.
10. The order status will be updated:
    * Normally, the orders will be updated successfully.
    * In cases where orders fail to be updated, the system will display the number of failed orders along with their information.

## Manual Drop Off

This allows Fleet Managers to manually update the status of an order from "Enroute" to "Delivered" in the Fleet Portal.

1. Go to the "Order List" in the Fleet Portal.
2. On the top of the Order List page, click on the "Action" button and select "Dropoff."
3. Like before, search and select the order you want to update.
   * By default, the order will show orders which are in "Enroute" status only.
   * By default, the list will be showing "Today’s" order only.

## Cancel

Fleet Managers cannot cancel orders in Fleet Portal.

1. They must first unassign an order in Fleet Portal, see [Unassigning an Order](assigning-orders-to-delivery-agents.md#unassigning-an-order).
2. Contact the Merchant/Administrator to cancel the order on Merchant Portal, see [Cancel Order](../merchant-portal/creating-and-managing-orders.md#cancel-order) under [Creating and Managing Orders](../merchant-portal/creating-and-managing-orders.md).

## Troubleshooting

You cannot find the order you want to update.

* Make sure you have selected the correct status ("Enroute" for 'Accepted' orders and "Dropoff" for 'Enroute' orders) in the 'Action' dropdown menu. Additionally, try to use different search parameters or filters.

The order status won't update.

* There may be a temporary glitch in the software. Try refreshing the page and repeating the process. If the problem persists, contact the Pickupp support team.

Some orders display as 'Failed' during the status update.

* There may be an issue with these orders. Check the order details for any inconsistencies. If you can't find anything wrong, report the issue to the Pickupp support team.
