# Managing Merchant Services

{% hint style="info" %}
To enable the merchant to place orders with the fleet, the merchant will send a service connection request to the fleet for approval. The fleet manager has the option to accept or reject the request. Additionally, the fleet manager can revoke the service at any time if the contract with the merchant is terminated or completed.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you are a new user of the Fleet Management System, your service is likely not yet connected to any merchants, and therefore no data is available. Please share your service ID with your merchants. Once you approve the service connection request, the "Merchant List" will display the relevant service connections, and they will be able to place orders with you. For more information, you can refer to [creating-fleet-service-connection.md](../getting-started/creating-fleet-service-connection.md "mention") to learn more about the Fleet Service Connection
