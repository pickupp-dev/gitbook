# Express Delivery - Tracking Status

## Accepted by Agent

A delivery agent has accepted the delivery order and will be handling the delivery. If the consignee would like to request a last minute change of delivery address or change of delivery date and time (which deviates from the system indicated timestamp), Pickupp would not be able to alter the trip and would request for the consignee to contact the merchant / sender. Pickupp will not be able to alter an existing delivery request and change the drop off date / time / location without merchant consent.&#x20;
