# Standard Delivery - Tracking Status

## Order Created

An order is created by the sender, and is recorded within the Pickupp system. Please note that the order is paid by the Sender, but may not be picked up from the point of origin.

## Warehouse processing

An order is already picked up from point of origin, sent to a sorting facility or processing warehousing for sorting and further handling. Please note that these warehouses have business hours, meaning if the items may be held at the processing warehouse over Sunday and public holidays. Please note that these processing warehouses are not open to public, and hence a self pick-up by individual or consignee may not be possible.
