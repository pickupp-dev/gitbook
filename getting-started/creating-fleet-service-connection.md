# Creating Fleet Service Connection

## Getting started with Fleet Service Connection

To empower merchants to connect to a fleet service, the process involves three major steps:

1.  **Fleet manager shares the service ID with the merchant**

    1.  Each fleet possesses at least one service ID, with each service ID corresponding to a specific service.

    2. Fleet managers can view their service details under the **My Services** section.
    3. Fleet managers share the service ID with merchants to establish a connection. A service connection guide is provided to the merchant to assist them in sending the connection request.\


    For details on how fleet manager can share their service ID to merchant, please refer to [managing-my-service.md](../fleet-portal-settings/managing-my-service.md "mention")\

2.  **Merchant sends the service connection request**

    1.  While fleets can have multiple service ID, merchants can connect to more than one fleet service as well.

    2. After receiving the service connection guide, the merchant sends a service connection request to the fleet manager.\


    For details on how merchant can send service connection request to fleet, please refer to [creating-fleet-service-connection.md](creating-fleet-service-connection.md "mention")\

3. **Fleet manager approves the request**
   1. The fleet manager has the option to <mark style="color:green;">**accept**</mark> or <mark style="color:red;">**reject**</mark> the service connection request from the merchant.
   2. If the fleet manager accepts the service connection request, a connection is established between the merchant and the fleet manager.
      1. The fleet manager retains the ability to revoke the service connection at any time if the contract with the merchant becomes invalid.
   3.  Once the service connection is established, the merchant can place orders with the fleet.
