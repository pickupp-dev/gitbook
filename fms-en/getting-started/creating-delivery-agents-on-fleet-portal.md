If a Delivery Agent is already registered on our Pickupp platform, you will see the message "This email or phone number is registered on the Pickupp platform already. Please contact the Pickupp support team for more information."

If a Delivery Agent is already added onto the Fleet Portal, you will see the message "Agent Existed".
