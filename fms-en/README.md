# What is the Pickupp Fleet Management?

Administrators and Fleet Managers can streamline the process of creating, assigning, and monitoring delivery orders, allowing for smoother operations and improved productivity.

## Introduction to Pickupp's Merchant Portal, Fleet Portal and Delivery Agent App

With its smart logistics technology platform, Pickupp serves both merchants (demand side) and fleets plus delivery agents (supply side). Our FMS therefore consists of three key components. They work together to streamline and manage the delivery process:

### **Merchant Portal**

The Merchant Portal is a responsive web-based interface that can be accessed through a web browser in Desktop, Tablet and Mobile device. It allows Administrators/Merchants to create and manage delivery orders using their preferred device.

### **Fleet Portal**

The Fleet Portal is a web-based interface for Administrators/Fleet Managers to oversee and optimize the entire fleet's operations. It is accessed through a web browser on a computer or any other mobile device with internet access.

### **Delivery Agent App**

This mobile app is used by Delivery Agents or Drivers to view, accept, swap and manage their assigned delivery orders.



You can easily move between Fleet Portal and Merchant Portal with a click of a button, please see [Fleet Portal <--> Merchant Portal Link](merchant-portal/creating-and-managing-orders.md#fleet-portal-less-than-greater-than-merchant-portal-link).
