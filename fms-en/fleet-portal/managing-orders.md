# Managing Orders

**Order List**: Provides a list of current orders based on various filters like Today orders, Pickup/Dropoff district, etc.

1. **Order Record Information**: Provides detailed information about each order status, order number, the assigned agent, merchant, pickup and dropoff information. It allows Fleet Managers to keep track of vital details for each order.
2. **Order Detail**: Displays detailed information about an order such as order number, status, responsible delivery agent, order notes, package quantity and dimensions, merchant, sender and recipient information, and proof of delivery for delivered orders.

## Order List

* To view more details about an order, click on the desired order.&#x20;
* A more detailed description of the order will appear (see [Order Details](managing-orders.md#order-details)).&#x20;
* Use filters to search for specific orders. You can filter by date, pickup/drop-off location, and more.

## Uploading Proof of Delivery (POD) on Order Detail Page

If for any reason Delivery Agent is unable to upload POD on the Pickupp Delivery Agent App (see [Confirming Delivered Orders](../delivery-agent-app/confirming-delivered-orders.md)), the Adminstrator/Fleet Manager can help the Delivery Agent upload the POD in Fleet Portal as well.

1. Press the Upload button as shown in the screenshot below.
