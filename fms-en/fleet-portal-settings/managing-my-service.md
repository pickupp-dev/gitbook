# Managing My Service



{% hint style="info" %}
Each fleet is assigned at least one service ID upon sign-up. If a merchant wishes to place an order with a fleet, the fleet manager must share the corresponding service ID with the merchant. This allows the merchant to send a service connection request to the fleet, initiating the process of establishing a connection between the two parties.
{% endhint %}
