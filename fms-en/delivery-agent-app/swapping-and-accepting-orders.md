# Swapping & Accepting Orders

The scanning feature is handy for fleet companies that manage numerous orders and allows smooth assignment or exchange of orders between different Delivery Agents within the same company.

## Scanning the Order QR Code

From a Delivery Agent's perspective:

1. Go to "My Order".
2. Click on "Scan Orders" to activate the camera (give the Delivery Agent App permission to access your camera, if asked).
3. "Scan the QR code" on the waybill or the QR code label. If the order contains multiple packages, the screen will show the rest of the package passcodes as tips on the upper part of the screen.
4. If the order is valid, a message will prompt you to confirm the acceptance of the order. Click "Confirm".
5. A success message will appear when the order is added to your "My Order" list.

## Inputting the Order Number

This option is best used if you are having trouble scanning the QR code or if your camera is not functioning properly.

From a Delivery Agent's perspective:

1. Go to "My Order".
2. Click on "Scan Orders" to activate the camera (give the app permission to access your camera, if asked).
3. Click on the "Pencil icon" at the top right corner.
4. Input the "Order Number" or the "Master CRN" as shown on the Waybill or QR code label. If the order contains multiple packages, you will need to enter each package's passcode.
5. Once you have entered the valid order details, a message will prompt you to confirm the acceptance of the order. Click "Confirm".
6. A success message will appear when the order is successfully added to your "My Order" list.
