3. Take a picture of the parcel and the background.
   * Ensure that the parcel and the destination background, such as the door sign, are visible in the picture. Please avoid capturing the face of the recipient for privacy reasons.
4. Submit Signature.
   * After finishing the "Scan QR code" and "Take Photo", click "Submit Signature".
   * Choose who is the actual recipient and ask them to sign on your phone.
