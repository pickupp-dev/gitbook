### a. Cake

Packaging Guidelines for Delivering a Cake:

1. Select a sturdy and appropriately sized box: Choose a box that is slightly larger than the cake to provide enough space for cushioning materials. The box should be made of durable material to protect the cake during transportation.
2. Prepare the box: Line the bottom of the box with a non-slip mat to prevent the cake from sliding during transit.
3. Use a cake board: Place the cake on a sturdy cake board that is slightly larger than the cake itself. This will provide stability and make it easier to handle the cake.
4. Secure the cake: Gently place the cake in the center of the prepared box and secure the cake board to the box with tape. If the cake is tall, consider using support dowels to prevent shifting or collapsing during transit. Ensure that the cake is placed level and centered to maintain its shape.
5. Seal the box: Close the box securely and tape all edges to prevent it from opening during delivery. Make sure the box is tightly sealed to avoid any air or moisture entering.
6. Label the box: Clearly label the box as "Fragile" or "Handle with Care" and "Keep the cake Upright" to alert the delivery personnel about the delicate nature of the contents.&#x20;
7. Keep the cake cool: If the cake requires refrigeration, include cold packs or insulated liners to maintain its freshness during transportation. Avoid exposing the cake to direct sunlight or extreme temperatures.

Following these packaging guidelines will help ensure that your cake arrives safely and in excellent condition to its destination.

3. Place the bottles in the shipping box: Carefully place the wrapped wine bottles into the compartments of the shipping box. Make sure they fit snugly and cannot move around during shipping. Add additional cushioning material, such as packing peanuts or air-filled packaging, to fill any empty spaces and provide extra protection.
