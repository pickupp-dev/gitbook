# Create a Fair Offered Price

1. Distance-Based Pricing
   * The base rate is our Pickupp 4 Hours point to point base price, meaning if traveling and commute is required, and is already captured when you enter the pick up and drop off address.
2.  Time-Based Pricing

    * We strongly recommend providing an estimated time span for task completion or arrival at the location, and adjust "acceptance tips" for the order to capture the time required to perform the task.&#x20;



    _Example: Let's use the same example, you would like an agent to deliver 10 mealboxes, when he arrives the warehouse location, help you set the table with table cloth, place the centrepiece, place the mealboxes on the left, and cutleries on the right. You estimated about 1hr would be sufficient for him to finish setting up in the destination. The current Delivery+ model already captures the distance and dimension / weight for delivery the mealboxes. However, you also require the agent to perform the extra catering setup, which you estimate to take around 30 mins to finish.  We suggest adding HK$30 in acceptance tips to capture the extra time (30mins) required to set up the table, take photos and upload the proof of work back in the system. You can refer to "_[_add tips_](add-tips-to-speed-up-agent-matching.md)_" section on how to add HK$30 to the order._
