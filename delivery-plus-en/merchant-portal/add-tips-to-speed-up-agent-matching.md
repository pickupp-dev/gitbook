## What if My Order is not Matched with an Agent

If your order is created and more than 90 minutes have passed without anyone accepting it, here's what you need to know:

1. If no one accepts your order within this time frame, it will be automatically canceled by the system. This cancellation occurs 60 minutes after the indicated "drop-off time" you provided.
2. Rest assured that a full refund will be issued to you automatically in such cases. You will receive the refund through the same payment method you used when placing the order.
3. If you would like to increase your chances of getting your order accepted, you have the option to increase the incentive offered via the "Add Acceptance Tip" section. In our merchant portal, you can make adjustments incrementally with different incentive amount. You can refer to the screencap in the above section for detailed instructions on how to do this.
4. Please note that Pickupp does not guarantee a match for every order under this service offering. While we strive to fulfill all orders, there may be instances where no suitable agent is available to accept your particular task (based on the complexity, skills and knowledge required).

We understand the importance of timely and efficient service, and we continuously work to improve the order acceptance process to ensure a seamless experience for our customers.
