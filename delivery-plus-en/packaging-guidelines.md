# Packaging Guidelines

## Quick Tips

1. Properly Package Inside & Outside

Choose an appropriately sized new cardboard box based on the item's size. Place internal cushioning materials for higher protection. Seal the outer box joints with packing tape to ensure safer product delivery. More details [below](packaging-guidelines.md#id-1.-properly-package-inside-and-outside).

2. Affix Order Information

Print the order label and paste it on the top of the box or write the 16-digit order number starting with "PU" on the top. This expedites the delivery process. More details [below](packaging-guidelines.md#id-2.-affix-shipping-information).
