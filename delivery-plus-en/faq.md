1. I see options "Express: 4 Hours Delivery" and "Delivery+: 4 Hours Delivery with Added Service", which ones should I choose?

If you only require a regular transfer or delivery of items on a point to point basis, with no additional instructions, skills and requirements, then you should pick Express : 4 Hours Delivery.&#x20;

However there are certain advantages and benefits of Delivery+ vs a regular Express 4 hours order. The benefits of Delivery+ is the flexibility of the service and the removal of restrictions of a regular parcel point to point transfer. When considering Delivery+ vs a regular Express 4 hours, you should think of the additional tasks and the complexity of the additional tasks involved. For example, Delivery+ should be used over a regular Express 4 hours when&#x20;

* your task is not a pure parcel delivery, when customized handling is required;
* when you have specific requests in pick up, drop off times that makes this a concierge type service;
* you may ask the freelancer to provide additional help other than a delivery and transport service;
* freelancer needs to be compensated for additional time spent and tasks on an hourly rate (e.g. assembling items, distribution of leaflets on the spot for a 2-hour shift)
* requirement may incur reimbursable expenses such as parking or paying on behalf of the user, on top of just commuting and handling items to be transported&#x20;
