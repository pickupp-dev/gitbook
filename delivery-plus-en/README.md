# What is Delivery+?

Delivery+ is a service provided by Pickupp that goes beyond simple delivery. It is a matching service that allows users to place orders and describe additional tasks they need assistance with. Users can visit the platform, specify their requirements, and request the help of a freelancer. The pricing for Delivery+ includes a distance-based fee just like our Pickupp Express delivery product, but users can also add "acceptance tips" to increase the chances of finding a match. If the order is not accepted by a freelancer, the request will be canceled and fully refunded, ensuring a success-based and free-of-charge experience.

Delivery+ is the new name for an initiative previously known as "Matchupp", which was introduced to merchants a month ago. The rebranding reflects our belief that this service is more than just a delivery platform. It offers greater flexibility to individuals, businesses, and enterprises, enabling them to easily find ad hoc help for various tasks.

## Example & Use Cases of Delivery+

Here are a few examples of how Delivery+ can be used:

1. Example 1: Moving Assistance. Let's say you need help moving furniture from one location to another. With Delivery+, you can place an order specifying the pick-up and drop-off locations, as well as the additional task of moving the furniture. A freelancer who accepts the order will not only deliver the items but also assist with the moving process, providing you with the extra help you need.
2. Example 2: Event Setup. Imagine you're organizing an event and need assistance with setting up equipment and decorations at the venue. By using Delivery+, you can place an order with the event location as the drop-off point and describe the specific tasks required, such as setting up tables, chairs, and decorations. A freelancer who accepts the order will not only deliver the items but also help with the setup, ensuring a smooth event preparation process.
3. Example 3: Document Retrieval. Suppose you need important documents from a specific location but are unable to retrieve them yourself. Through Delivery+, you can place an order to have a freelancer pick up the documents and deliver them to your desired location. You can provide clear instructions on where to find the documents and any additional requirements, ensuring a secure and efficient retrieval process.

These examples demonstrate how Delivery+ offers more than just simple delivery. It allows users to request assistance with specific tasks, enabling them to accomplish multiple objectives in a single order. With the added flexibility of acceptance tips, users can increase the likelihood of finding a suitable match and receive the help they need.
